# SWISS-CODING-FINAL-PROJECT

## A - Project title:

LADA's sales analysis.

## B - Purpose and Outcome:

*Purpose:* 

To help LADA's management understand the insights behind sales situation over 3 year (2021-2023) and customer segments through studying LADA's sales database

*Outcome:* 

- Meaningfull insights into sales situation of the company over 3 years in general, and each year in detail.
- Try to understand the main features of the potential customers or popular model that LADA should focus their sales promotions on in the future.

## C - **Technologies**

In this project, I intend to use Python and its labraries for the cleaning step before doing any further EDA and export cleaned dataset to csv file.  
For download dataset, I decide to use Kaggel's API to diectly get the raw data from this website.

In the visualization step, i use Power BI for mainly visualization and doing some more further analysis. 

I currently use Github to store all the images, code and documentaion for this project. The repo is public for referencing and studying.

## E - Initial Analysis plan:

In this project, I intend to start with cleaning and furnishing the dataset first; and then perform furrther correlation analysis and generate actionable insights from the data.

#### Data cleaning:

a/ Data loading: I use Kaggle API to get the data. Below is the code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns


# Install Kaggle API in Google Colab
!pip install kaggle

from google.colab import files
files.upload()

import os
# Make a directory to store Kaggle credentials
os.makedirs('/root/.kaggle', exist_ok=True)

# Move the kaggle.json file into this directory
!mv kaggle.json /root/.kaggle/

# Change the permissions of the kaggle.json file
!chmod 600 /root/.kaggle/kaggle.json

!kaggle datasets download -d artemcheremuhin/lada-car-sales

!unzip lada-car-sales.zip

# Read the csv files in dataset

# Load the dataset
df_buyer = pd.read_csv('lada_buyers.csv')

# Display the first few rows - 1st dataset:
df_buyer.head()
```

b/ Data Profiling: Sine the columns for analysisng is loacated in 2 different dataframe so that I join the 2 dataframes to gain a consolidated table including all the columns of the 2 dataframe, using **purchase_id** columns in 2 tables as key;

- I use the below code:
  ```python
  # combine 2 table using purchase_id as foreign key
  df_joined = pd.merge(df_buyer, df_machine, on='purchase_id', how='outer')

  # check the data head again: 
  df_joined.head()
  ```
  So my result is:
  
|   | purchase_id |     id | Age | Sex |   Income | Purchase_Date |                  Region |  Model |     Price | Engine_Power | Transmission | Fuel_Type | Num_Additional_Options |

c/ Fixing data types: object → string/date/category ; fix dates using :

- I check the info of joined dataframe and see that there are some columns do not have the dtype that I want:
   ```python
   # check columns and dtypes:
   df_joined.info()

   # >> result:

      <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
   RangeIndex: 5532 entries, 0 to 5531
   Data columns (total 13 columns):
    #   Column                  Non-Null Count  Dtype  
   ---  ------                  --------------  -----  
    0   purchase_id             5532 non-null   int64  
    1   id                      5532 non-null   int64  
    2   Age                     5532 non-null   int64  
    3   Sex                     5532 non-null   object 
    4   Income                  5532 non-null   float64
    5   Purchase_Date           5532 non-null   object 
    6   Region                  5532 non-null   object 
    7   Model                   5532 non-null   object 
    8   Price                   5532 non-null   float64
    9   Engine_Power            5532 non-null   int64  
    10  Transmission            5532 non-null   object 
    11  Fuel_Type               5532 non-null   object 
    12  Num_Additional_Options  5532 non-null   int64  
   dtypes: float64(2), int64(5), object(6)
   memory usage: 562.0+ KB
   ```
- I will not use df_joined.convert_dtypes().dtypes to auto convert dtypes of object columns. Instead I will convert dtype for each colum to get the corect dtype for each cloumn:
```python
# Convert columns with object dtype to category:

df_joined['purchase_id'] = df_joined['purchase_id'].astype('string')
df_joined['id'] = df_joined['id'].astype('string')

# Convert columns with object dtype to category (if they are categorical variables)

df_joined['Sex'] = df_joined['Sex'].astype('category')
df_joined['Region'] = df_joined['Region'].astype('category')
df_joined['Model'] = df_joined['Model'].astype('category')
df_joined['Transmission'] = df_joined['Transmission'].astype('category')
df_joined['Fuel_Type'] = df_joined['Fuel_Type'].astype('category')

# convert object to datetime  type:
df_joined['Purchase_Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_joined['Purchase_Date'], format="%Y-%m-%d", errors='coerce')
```
... then check the df.info() again to see the result:

```python
# check dtype after convert dtypes:
df_joined.info()

# >> result:
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 5532 entries, 0 to 5531
Data columns (total 13 columns):
 #   Column                  Non-Null Count  Dtype         
---  ------                  --------------  -----         
 0   purchase_id             5532 non-null   string        
 1   id                      5532 non-null   string        
 2   Age                     5532 non-null   int64         
 3   Sex                     5532 non-null   category      
 4   Income                  5532 non-null   float64       
 5   Purchase_Date           5532 non-null   datetime64[ns]
 6   Region                  5532 non-null   category      
 7   Model                   5532 non-null   category      
 8   Price                   5532 non-null   float64       
 9   Engine_Power            5532 non-null   int64         
 10  Transmission            5532 non-null   category      
 11  Fuel_Type               5532 non-null   category      
 12  Num_Additional_Options  5532 non-null   int64         
dtypes: category(5), datetime64[ns](1), float64(2), int64(3), string(2)
memory usage: 374.6 KB
```
d/ Removing Duplicates: Check Number of Duplicate Rows using df.duplicated().sum()
- I run the code . to see whether or not my columns contain duplicates:
  ```python
  df_joined.duplicated().sum()

  # >> result
  0
  ```
There is no duplicates so that I don't need to do anything else for this step and assume that my dataframe has no duplicate.

e/ Handling Missing Values: using df.isnull().sum(); this dataset has no missing value so I do not need to do this step.
- I run the below code to check if the df has mising values:
  ```python
  # check mising value:
  df_joined.isnull().sum()
  ```
and the result:

|                        | 0 |
|-----------------------:|---|
|       purchase_id      | 0 |
|           id           | 0 |
|           Age          | 0 |
|           Sex          | 0 |
|         Income         | 0 |
|      Purchase_Date     | 0 |
|         Region         | 0 |
|          Model         | 0 |
|          Price         | 0 |
|      Engine_Power      | 0 |
|      Transmission      | 0 |
|        Fuel_Type       | 0 |
| Num_Additional_Options | 0 |
| dtype: int64           |   |


f/ Summary Statistics for Numerical Columns and Non-Numeric Columns:
- I use the below code to see basic desctiptive analysic abot the Numerical Columns and Non-Numeric Columns in this df.

```python
# Summary Statistics for Numerical Columns:
df_joined.describe()

```
and the result:

|       |         Age |       Income |                 Purchase_Date |        Price | Engine_Power | Num_Additional_Options |

```python
# Summary Statistics for Non-Numeric Columns

# Filter non-numeric (categorical) columns
non_numeric_df_joined = df_joined.select_dtypes(include=['string', 'category'])

# Get the summary statistics for non-numeric columns and display:
non_numeric_df_joined.describe()
```

and the result:

|        | purchase_id |     id |  Sex |                  Region |  Model | Transmission | Fuel_Type |
|-------:|------------:|-------:|-----:|------------------------:|-------:|-------------:|----------:|

g/ Checking consistency: 
- I decide to check and Fix any Inconsistencise of Non-Numeric column in df:

```python
# check to see all the colum of this df
df_joined.columns

# >> result:

Index(['purchase_id', 'id', 'Age', 'Sex', 'Income', 'Purchase_Date', 'Region',
       'Model', 'Price', 'Engine_Power', 'Transmission', 'Fuel_Type',
       'Num_Additional_Options'],
      dtype='obje
```
- Then I use a function called check_unique_values(df) . tocheck the number of unique value in each colum:

```python
# Define a function to check unique values for each column in the DataFrame
def check_unique_values(df):
    # Iterate over each column and print the number of unique values
    unique_values = df.nunique()

    # Display the result
    for column, unique_count in unique_values.items():
        print(f"Column '{column}' has {unique_count} unique values.")

# Example usage with df_joined
check_unique_values(df_joined)

# >> result:
'''
Column 'purchase_id' has 5532 unique values.
Column 'id' has 5000 unique values.
Column 'Age' has 39 unique values.
Column 'Sex' has 2 unique values.
Column 'Income' has 777 unique values.
Column 'Purchase_Date' has 36 unique values.
Column 'Region' has 14 unique values.
Column 'Model' has 20 unique values.
Column 'Price' has 51 unique values.
Column 'Engine_Power' has 13 unique values.
Column 'Transmission' has 2 unique values.
Column 'Fuel_Type' has 2 unique values.
Column 'Num_Additional_Options' has 6 unique values.
'''
```
- Then, i change the items in such categorical columns, that might possibly contains inconsistent values, into lower letter and check the unique values again

```python
# Check consitency of col='Region' by counting the unique values after I change all items in col='Region' to lower letter

df_joined['Region'] = df_joined['Region'].str.lower()
len(df_joined['Region'].unique())

# >> result: 14

# the number of unique values unchanges >> no inconsistent values

# check consitency of col='Model' by counting the unique values after I change all items in col='Model' to lower letter

df_joined['Model'] = df_joined['Model'].str.lower()
len(df_joined['Model'].unique())

# >> result: 20

# the number of unique values unchanges >> no inconsistent values
```
After the checking, I noticed that th df does not contain inconsistent colum

g/ Outlier Detection and Handling:

- From the descriptive analysis above, I check all the colums to see if I need to remove outliers for any colums.
- The age colum contain min values at 25 and max values at 65. This is reasonably match with the range of human being age so I don't need to remove outliers for this column:
- I notice the Income column might contain outliers since in the customer group, there might have some individual with extraordinary income range. Hence, I use IQR to dèine lower and upper bound; and boxplot as well to check.

```python
# Find IQR df_joined['Income'] :

# Quartiles calcualtion
Q1 = df_joined['Income'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df_joined['Income'].quantile(0.75)

# IQR calculation
IQR = Q3 - Q1

# Lower and Upper bounds for non-outliers calculating
lower_bound = Q1 - 2 * IQR # dùng 2 * IQR thay vì 1.5 * IQR để  hạ thấp lower bound
upper_bound = Q3 + 2 * IQR # dùng 2 * IQR thay vì 1.5 * IQR để nâng cao upper bound

cond1 = df_joined['Income'] >= lower_bound
cond2 = df_joined['Income'] <= upper_bound

df_joined_clean = df_joined[cond1 & cond2]

# check summary of df_joined afer remove outliers of df_joined['Income']
df_joined_clean.info()

# >> result:

<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
Index: 5419 entries, 0 to 5531
Data columns (total 13 columns):
 #   Column                  Non-Null Count  Dtype         
---  ------                  --------------  -----         
 0   purchase_id             5419 non-null   string        
 1   id                      5419 non-null   string        
 2   Age                     5419 non-null   int64         
 3   Sex                     5419 non-null   category

 6   Region                  5419 non-null   object        
 7   Model                   5419 non-null   object

 11  Fuel_Type               5419 non-null   category      
 12  Num_Additional_Options  5419 non-null   int64         
dtypes: category(3), datetime64[ns](1), float64(2), int64(3), object(2), string(2)
memory usage: 481.9+ KB

```
The df_joined_clean now contains 5419 entries, 113 unit less incomparison to the df_joined.

```python
# Số lượng outlier được loại bỏ ra khỏi model:
outlier_num = df_joined['purchase_id'].count()-df_joined_clean['purchase_id'].count()

# tỉ trọng outlier trong dataset
outlier_per = outlier_num / df_joined['purchase_id'].count() * 100

print('Number of Outliers: ', outlier_num)
print('Percentage of Outlier among the whole dataset: ', outlier_per)

# >> result:
Number of Outliers:  113
Percentage of Outlier among the whole dataset:  2.0426608821402747
```
Next, I check the boxplot to see . the difference:

```python
# boxplot to check outliers of 'Income','Price' : dataframe trước khi loại bỏ outliers

df_joined.boxplot(column=['Income','Price'])
```

From the result: the df_joined_clean have less outlers for further analysis.

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- I have a question that How many years that a customer (in this dataset) need to afford a car, asuming that his/ her income does not change over years? So that I add . aclumn for futher analysis:

```python
# Add 1 more colum: Number of saving year to afford a model:
df_joined_clean['Saving_year_num'] = df_joined_clean['Price'] / df_joined['Income']
```
- Then I create visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships : correlation, histograms, pair plots, correlation:

```python
# Check correlation between numeric coumns:
df_numeric_cols = df_joined_clean.select_dtypes('number')

# calculate correlation matrix of numeric columns in df_joined_clean:
correlation_matrix = df_numeric_cols.corr()
correlation_matrix
```
>> Result:

```python
# Visualizing the Correlation:
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix Heatmap')

plt.show()
```
Result:

And the result:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b3ea33d-8448-4858-8b0e-96e33eaf5c55)

- For details, I also check the scatter plot for some specific colums:

```python
# Scatter plot for Income vs Saving_year_num:

plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
sns.scatterplot(data=df_joined_clean, x='Saving_year_num', y='Income')

plt.title('Scatter plot for Income vs Saving_year_num')

plt.show()
```

- I also draw histomgram to see in distribution of gender in the dataset:

```python
# plot histogram for colum Sex
plt.figure(figsize=(5,5))

plt.hist(df_joined_clean['Sex'], bins=10, color='tan', edgecolor='white')

# set title
plt.title('Histogram for Sex')
plt.xlabel('Sex')

```
Result: 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a55e0ee-0eba-48ff-b3df-b740f731e66b)


Then I export the dataframe to csv for further analysis and visualization in Power BI. The files are stored in this Github repo of mine.

```python
# export the dataframe to csv file for EDA in Power BI
df_joined_clean.to_csv('lada_sales_clean_df.csv', index=False)

# export the dataframe to csv file for EDA in Power BI
df_joined.to_csv('lada_sales_df.csv', index=False)
```

#### Visualization:

I decided to mainly use Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics that I studied from the dataset. Some of the histogram chart, correlation heatmap ... to display the relationship between variables are done by Python.

Popular charts for visualization that I used are:

- Slicers 
- Pie/Donut charts  
- Stacked columns/bars charts
- Clustered bar charts
- Map
- Line charts
- Table


#### **Data Storytelling**

For datastorytelling and presentation, I decide to use Power BI and REAMDE.md to present my analysis, insights findings and recommendation.

## **F - Outcome**

### **1. Recommendations**

- **Sales Strategy**:
    - Suggest strategies to boost sales in underperforming regions.
        - According to the sales and revenue analysis, LADA should focus their resources (human, facilities, outlets…) to the 3 biggest regions they occupied :  **Republic of Bashkortostan, Republic of Tatartsan** and **Nizhny Novgorod Oblast.** They also need to investigate the root cause for sales declined in these 3 regions in such summer months (Mar, April and May)
        - Since that **Republic of Mari El** is the region having least contribute to sales or revenue of the whole company, LADA should also consider on whether or not they should close the outlets in this region. In case they does not want to loose this region to other rivals, LADA should have ,much more efficient solutions to investigate the root cause for sales decrease in some specific months of year; and improve sales performance of this region as well.
          
    - Recommendations for focusing on high-demand models or transmission types.
        - Customer usually place orders for MT type rather than AT type so that LADA should consider this point in making sales & marketing plans for promotion of their models or find out solutions to boost the sales of AT transmission type cars.
        - _For granta_:
            - **Recommendation**: Since granta has consistently performed well, with the highest sales in 2021 and a significant share of total sales (29.46% higher than the lowest-selling model), it is crucial to continue promoting granta as a flagship model due to its popularity. Consider increasing its production capacity or improving availability in regions with higher demand.
            - **Action**: Launch targeted marketing campaigns emphasizing Granta's value proposition. Highlight its affordability and popularity to attract a broader customer base, especially in regions where it already performs well.
        - _For the 2 model 2107 and 2113_ :
            - **Recommendation**: Both models have shown strong sales performance over the past three years. Maintain focus on these models by refining their features, offering more customization options, and potentially introducing limited-edition variants to keep the demand high.
            - **Action**: Expand distribution of 2107 and 2113 in high-performing regions. Introduce loyalty programs or trade-in offers to keep existing customers engaged with these models.
        - _For 2111 Model_:
            - **Recommendation**: With only 241 units sold, the 2111 model has the lowest sales and may not be resonating well with customers. Evaluate the reasons for its poor performance — whether it's due to pricing, lack of features, or shifting customer preferences.
            - **Action**: Consider rebranding or redesigning the 2111 model, focusing on improving its key selling points (e.g., fuel efficiency, engine power, or interior features). If the model is not delivering satisfactory returns, it may be worth phasing it out or reducing its presence in the market. Alternatively, reposition the 2111 model as a more affordable entry-level option if the customer segment is price-sensitive.
              
    - Trend Monitoring to Adapt to Market Shifts:
        - **Recommendation**: The taste for LADA car models has shifted over the years. Continuous monitoring of sales data, customer reviews, and competitor activities will allow LADA to stay ahead of changing market demands and adapt its models accordingly.
        - **Action**: Set up a system for quarterly reviews of car model performance to quickly identify trends. Adapt production schedules, marketing efforts, and distribution channels based on this data.
          
- **Revenue Optimization**:
    - *Diversify the Model Portfolio by Product Line Expansion:* ****
        - **Recommendation**: To capture a broader customer base, LADA should consider expanding its portfolio to cater to different segments (e.g., electric vehicles or hybrids) or introducing models with higher-end features to appeal to premium buyers.
        - **Action**: Use customer feedback, regional preferences, and competitor analysis to introduce new variants or models that fill market gaps. For example, focusing on eco-friendly vehicles could align with global shifts toward sustainability.
    - *Tailor Marketing and Sales Efforts:*
        - **Recommendation**: Given that customer preferences for LADA models vary by year and region, it is crucial to implement a region-specific marketing strategy. For example, in regions where the granta and 2107 perform well, further emphasize their cost-effectiveness and dependability.
        - **Action:** Use sales data to craft targeted campaigns in regions where specific models are popular.
    - *Enhance Customer Experience and Engagement - Think about customer Retention Programs:*
        - **Recommendation**: Given that granta, 2107, and 2113 models contribute significantly to total sales, it’s essential to create a loyal customer base for these models. Introduce post-purchase services, loyalty rewards, and referral programs to encourage repeat purchases and word-of-mouth marketing.
        - **Action**: Offer complimentary services (e.g., free maintenance for the first year) for buyers of popular models. Implement a customer satisfaction survey to identify areas for improvement.
    - *Focus on High-Revenue Models (granta, 2107, and 2113)*
        - **granta, 2107, and 2113**: These models have consistently generated the most revenue for LADA, accounting for 16.86% of total revenue over the 3 years. They are the most successful models in terms of sales and profitability.
        - **Recommendation**: Increase the production of these high-performing models to meet the demand. Focus on enhancing their features, quality, and customer satisfaction to maintain and potentially grow their revenue contribution.
        - **Action**:
            - Launch targeted marketing campaigns focusing on the value and affordability of Granta, 2107, and 2113, especially in regions with high demand.
            - Offer exclusive accessories, upgrades, and limited-edition variants to increase the average selling price (ASP) of these models.
            - Expand sales channels to reach more customers, including online sales platforms and regional dealerships.
    - *Reevaluate and Potentially Phase Out Low-Revenue Models (e.g., 2111):*
        - **2111 Model**: The 2111 has underperformed, contributing just 4.44% to total revenue with only 241 units sold.
        - **Recommendation**: Consider rebranding, updating, or discontinuing the 2111 model. If the model continues to underperform, it may be more cost-effective to phase it out and focus on more profitable models.
        - **Action**:
            - Analyze customer feedback to identify why the 2111 model is unpopular (e.g., pricing, features, or consumer preferences).
            - If a redesign is feasible, update the 2111 with newer features, a more attractive price point, or improved performance to boost its appeal.
            - Alternatively, reallocate resources to the more successful models and reduce inventory for the 2111.
    - *Target High-Revenue Regions for Growth:*
        - **Republic of Bashkortostan, Republic of Tatarstan, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast**: These regions have contributed significantly to revenue, with a total of 4.2 billion over 3 years.
        - **Recommendation**: Focus on deepening LADA's presence in these regions, which already account for a substantial portion of total revenue. Develop region-specific strategies to boost sales further.
        - **Action**:
            - Expand promotional efforts in these regions, potentially with localized advertisements or partnerships with local influencers to boost brand visibility.
            - Offer region-specific deals and incentives for loyal customers (e.g., discounts for repeat buyers or trade-in options).
            - Open more showrooms or increase distribution networks to ensure LADA models are easily accessible in high-performing regions.
    - *Explore Underperforming Regions (e.g., Republic of Mari El):*
        - **Republic of Mari El**: This region has contributed the least to total revenue.
        - **Recommendation**: Investigate why this region has underperformed. It could be due to low brand awareness, economic conditions, or a mismatch between LADA's offerings and local preferences.
        - **Action**:
            - Conduct market research to better understand consumer behavior and preferences in Mari El. Adjust product offerings, pricing strategies, or marketing messages to meet local needs.
            - Offer special promotions, such as price reductions or financing options, to stimulate demand.
            - Consider localized marketing campaigns, emphasizing LADA's value proposition and catering to the specific preferences of the Mari El population.
    - *Capitalize on Transmission Type Preferences (MT vs AT):*
        - **Recommendation**: Since automatic transmission (AT) is preferred, focus on increasing its availability and improving its appeal.
        - **Action**:
            - Increase production of AT models if they are generating higher revenue and have greater demand. Ensure that the supply of AT models matches the growing demand.
            - If manual transmission (MT) models are still significant in certain regions, maintain a balanced offering to cater to both preferences.
            - Promote the benefits of AT cars (e.g., ease of driving, fuel efficiency, and advanced technology) in regions where there is strong demand for automatic vehicles.
    - *Increase Average Selling Price (ASP):*
        - **Recommendation**: To offset revenue declines due to lower overall sales, focus on strategies to increase the average selling price (ASP) of LADA vehicles.
            - **Action**:
                - Introduce additional options, customizations, or premium versions of popular models, which can drive up the ASP.
                - Develop attractive financing and leasing options to make higher-priced models more accessible to customers.
                - Offer add-on services, such as extended warranties, maintenance packages, and insurance, to increase the total transaction value per customer.
    - *Revenue Diversification:*
        - **Recommendation**: Explore ways to diversify LADA's revenue streams beyond car sales, especially in light of economic downturns affecting revenue growth.
        - **Action**:
            - Develop and promote a strong after-sales service network to increase service-related revenue (e.g., maintenance, repairs, accessories).
            - Explore the introduction of LADA-branded merchandise, accessories, or extended warranties to capture additional revenue from existing customers.
            - Investigate the potential for LADA to enter electric vehicle (EV) or hybrid car markets. Of course this might severely affect the production cost but , in return, this may help LADA catch-up with latest technology trends, attract new customer segments and increase revenue potential.
    - *Adjust Marketing Strategies for Revenue Maximization:*

        - **Action**:

### **2. Conclusion**

The analysis of LADA car sales and customer demographics reveals several important insights. The largest customer group is aged 45–55, accounting for over 70% of total sales, with the age bins of 50 and 55 being the most prominent. Customers aged 25–35 represent the smallest share of sales, but they tend to spend more on higher-end models. Over the years, sales among younger customers and those over 58 have decreased, while the 45–55 age group has consistently increased. There is a weak correlation between age and car model preferences, though customers aged 45–55 prefer models like Granta, 2107, and 2113.

In terms of gender, 90.87% of buyers are male, with female customers concentrated in specific regions like Tatarstan. This gender imbalance remains consistent over the years and across regions. Income analysis shows that the majority of customers earn under 300,000 RUB annually, with a small percentage of high-income customers (900,000–1,000,000 RUB). Younger buyers (under 30) tend to spend more on expensive models, whereas older customers with higher incomes prefer affordable models.

Customers generally save for 1.66 years to afford their cars, with younger buyers typically saving longer due to lower incomes and higher model prices. There is a strong negative correlation between income and the number of saving years, while a positive correlation exists between car price and saving duration. Regional analysis highlights high revenue-generating areas such as Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, and Nizhny Novgorod, while regions like Mari El underperform.

In conclusion, to optimize sales, LADA should focus marketing efforts on the 45–55 age group, promote budget-friendly models for low-income buyers, and introduce flexible financing for younger customers. Regional strategies should be tailored to high-performing regions, while efforts in underperforming areas should involve market research and targeted promotions. Additionally, attention to gender-specific marketing could help increase the female customer base.
